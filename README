This is a quick python node to help analyze the effect of temperature
on depthcam skew.

To build:
---------
Install some build dependencies
sudo apt install libudev-dev libudev1 libusb-dev

NOTE: Might also need libusb-1.0-0 and/or libusb-1.0-0-dev

In your catkin workspace:

cd catkin_ws/src
git clone https://github.com/BadgerTechnologies/ros_astra_camera.git
cd ros_astra_camera.git
git checkout -b features/temperature-sensor origin/features/temperature-sensor
cd ..

git clone https://github.com/BadgerTechnologies/ros_astra_launch.git


catkin build (or catkin_make)

Need to re-load the ROS environment into your shell:
source ../devel/setup.bash

To run:
-------
roscore&

# Set the camera into same resolution we use on robot 120x160
# Note that the default mode is 5 (480x640)
rosparam set /camera/driver/depth_mode 11

roslaunch astra_launch astrapro.launch

In another shell, run the python program:
./depth_image_skew_analyzer/depth_image_skew_analyzer
